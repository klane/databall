scrapy crawl teams
scrapy crawl games -a teams=Atlanta-Hawks

# The following is only going to work in bash but its a simple loop that can be used to scrape all team data
for i in `cat full_name.txt`; do scrapy crawl games -a teams=$i; done


# Notes
# Settings.py will need to be modified with the database location
#
# If looking to scrape older seasons the season will need to be manually modified right now.
