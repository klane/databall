This project combines my interest in data science with my love of sports. I attempt to predict NBA winners against the spread using stats pulled from the [NBA stats website](http://stats.nba.com/) with [nba_py](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py) and point spreads and over/under lines from [covers.com](http://covers.com) using the Python web scraping framework [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). All code is written in Python and I used the popular machine learning library [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to make all predictions.
