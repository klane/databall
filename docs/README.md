This folder contains the code required to build the GitHub Pages [site](https://klane.github.io/databall/) for this project. The site uses a slightly modified version of the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Several of the [pages](https://github.com/klane/databall/tree/gh-pages/_pages) and all the [images](https://github.com/klane/databall/tree/gh-pages/assets/images) were generated by converting the Jupyter notebooks to Markdown with [jekyllnb](https://github.com/klane/jekyllnb).
