This folder contains the code required to build the GitHub Pages [site](https://klane.github.io/databall/) for this project. The site uses a slightly modified version of the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Several of the [pages](https://github.com/klane/databall/tree/master/docs/_pages) and all the [images](https://github.com/klane/databall/tree/master/docs/assets/images) were generated by converting my Jupyter notebooks to Markdown with [nbprocess](https://github.com/klane/databall/tree/master/nbprocess).
